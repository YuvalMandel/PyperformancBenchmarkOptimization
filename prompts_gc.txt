During work we used :cursor chatgpt and gemini, asking for sources and double-checking when relvant. 

can you allaborate about writing c extensions in c vs cython, focusing on the bindings and the c-api aspects?
how often can you use __slots__ in python and it will not harm functionality , are there studies about this?
what happens between python and cython ?
i would like to run perf and create flamegraphs using this sitehttps://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html#Instructions
create a bash script i can just run with the parameters being the file and sample rate
lets say i ran perf and i only want the script to take the perf.data file and create a flamegraph
i got this[ ] Generating folded stacks from perf.data..../generate_flamegraph.sh: line 26: /root/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl: No such file or directory*
can i have something that shows me progress?
how long should it take to run this on a 350 mb perf.data file ?
save perf report into file
im trying to create a report and cannots
tryed to install and got this
did that and still get
i get Error: unknown option `no-kernel'*
what does asizeof from pympler measureso wait, if i have a linked list, the first node that refernces the second will show the combined size of all nodes?
create a base for a run.sh script and instruct me on how to fill up the gaps
incorparate the flamegraph creation into this script
edit the script to reflect the following for the gc_collect.py the output will be in ms for the gc_collect_opt the output will be in us adjust accordingly
make the same change, ie capturing the runtime from the run, for gc_collect_opt as well
ok everything ran fairly well, there is one problem the benchmark run time will not show up in the gc_report.txt , it only shows up on screen right after a run of the gc_collect.py , including runs with perf recordthe runtime needs to be captured right after a runthe runs are short enough, you can run it with just python3-dbg gc_collect.py right when you capture the data
i got this instead of what i need why? fix it
python3-dbg -m pyperf systTune the system configuration to run benchmarks
is there a site online to which i can upload my perf.data and get a flamegraph
my perf.data file is too big how can i get a smaller file to work with ?
give me the most simple commands to create a flamegraph from a perf.data
show me in text format the prompts i used during this chat
write me a pyinstruments command to run a pyperformence benchmark with a sample interval of 0.0001
i cant run the spesific one
i want to get the html from pyinstruments
im trying to use this script but i cant seem to see the whole folder on the site
become familiar with the numba library and profila profiling toolhow can i get the most detail from the profila
explain using Intel VTune Profiler

Is it possible to create a gc_collect implamentation that is cache aware and includes prefetch?
What are all the files of gc collect with prefetch? I need a simple prefetch were pre-running I choose the prefetch size
Take cache_aware_nodes.py, and write it in a new file witrh a simple prefetch like in cache_aware_gc_collect.py
Don't do any special printing, just regualr pyperf
Look at cache_aware_nodes. I want to look inside the python interpeter and see if I can optimize it further
For cache_aware_node_list_gc_collect.py, add a prefetch option based on the cache sizes. What is the optimal size?
give me a manual on adding python to the path
can i write a Concurrent Mark-Sweep for python in c ?
can i usr jython to use cms and make my gc.collect faster?
create a full working cms_collector.c
what is checked in gc traversal in pyperformance?
what is the output of gc_collect?
can i in python tell the cpu which of the if options is more likly ?
i want to use perf to profile a spesific section of code, whats the easyiest way?
so leys say i have a file named myfile.py and i want to record only the function benchamark_collection from start to return
write a manual
thats actually super unhelpful thank you
is Cpython garbage collector copying?
explain further about boxing and unboxing
cms gc collect does it need spesialized hardware?
explain the benefits and cons of adding instructions
